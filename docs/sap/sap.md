## Debug Payment Run

1. Set a Break-Point in the program / Function module
2. Start the Payment Proposal Run in F110 without "Start immediately", for example using start time 12pm
3. go to the Job Overview page using transaction `SM37` / `SMX` &#8594; mark the F110 Job &#8594; enter `JDBG` in the execution bar, this will start the Job
4. It should stop at the Break-Point

## Find BADIs for an executed transaction &#8594; `CL_EXITHANDLER`

- Go to transaction `SE80` Class `CL_EXITHANDLER`
- navigate to method `get_instance` and set a Break-Point in the first line of `cl_exithandler=>get_class_name_by_interface`
- Use the transaction in which you are BAdI-hunting
- Examine the contents of the field exit_name whenever the processing stops at the breakpoint. I have found a case where exit_name was an unknown field. Then class_name gave a good clue to the name of the BAdI.

### Configure tax codes that will be available for end-users

Transaction: `OBZT`

In this transaction you can configure the tax codes that will be available for end-users in FI-AP (FB60 / FB65) / FI-AR (FB70 / FB75) transactions as well as logistics invoice verification (MIRO).

You can also set some tax code as default one in these transactions. Screenshot of typical tax codes settings can be found below. Note: the visibility of input tax codes can be customized differently for FI-AP accounting and logistics invoice verification (in case, when FI-AP should be used only in certain cases that require specific tax codes). In this example the visibility of input tax codes was customized in the same way for FI-AP and MM-LIV areas.

### Open and close booking periods

Transaction `OB52`

### Reverse Payment Run (`F110`)

With the program `RFF110S_REVERSE` (F110: Reverse Payment Run) a complete payment run can be canceled.

To do so some previous steps have to be executed...

**What to do if payment media have already been created?**

Reset the EDI status using the program `RFFOEDI2`.

![RFFOEDI2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30869493/143263710-fc0e2bfa-7d48-46a3-be58-1545ba19e451.png)

**Reset table entries**

The table entries should now be reset using the program `RFPAYM_RESET`.

![RFPAYM_RESET](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30869493/143263794-12ffa586-5923-4dfb-a93a-f4c28226e76f.png)

**Now you can execute `RFF110S_REVERSE`**

![RFF110S_REVERSE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30869493/143263560-3e2054df-55e1-460b-bbbd-d8a646975aae.png)

### Change limit of payment run (`FBZP`)`

Transaction: `FBZP`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30869493/148197363-fedbb961-4af2-47e2-a485-cb7cc33c238e.png)

The whole thing can be circumvented a bit by entering the payment method in an invoice.
Then all without a payment method are added up for the vendor (under limit) and an invoice with payment method as one payment (under limit). However, if an invoice is over the limit, the limit must be adjusted.
